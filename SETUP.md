# IMP Digital - Contact Forms Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Resend API integration to make all contact forms functional.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Get Your Resend API Key

1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Navigate to your dashboard and create a new API key
3. Copy the API key (it starts with `re_`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (`imp-digital-site/.env.local`) with the following content:

```env
# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Email Configuration
FROM_EMAIL=hello@impdigital.com
TO_EMAIL=hello@impdigital.com

# Site Configuration
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `your_resend_api_key_here` with your actual Resend API key
- Replace `hello@impdigital.com` with your actual domain email
- For the `FROM_EMAIL` to work, you need to verify your domain with Resend

### 3. Domain Verification (Required for Production)

For production use, you need to verify your domain with Resend:

1. In your Resend dashboard, go to "Domains"
2. Add your domain (e.g., `impdigital.com`)
3. Follow the DNS verification steps provided by Resend
4. Once verified, you can send emails from any address at your domain

### 4. Testing with Development

For testing during development, you can use Resend's sandbox mode:
- Use `onboarding@resend.dev` as the `FROM_EMAIL`
- This will work without domain verification
- Emails will only be sent to verified email addresses in your account
